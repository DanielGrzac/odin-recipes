    <h1>Char Siu (BBQ Pork)</h1>
    
    <img src="../imgs/bbq-pork.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The wonderfully sweet and savory flavor of this Chinese dish comes from a unique blend of pantry ingredients. Soy sauce, honey, ketchup, and brown sugar create the base of the luscious marinade, while hoisin sauce and red bean curd add depth.</p>
    <p>Juicy pork tenderloin is the main event of this 5-star recipe. Choose two 1 lb. tenderloins for best results, substituting pork loin or pork chops if necessary.</p>
    <p>Char siu can be eaten as is, over rice, or paired with bright green vegetables for a great contrast. Use this zesty pork to stuff steamed buns, in pork fried rice, or as a topping in</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Chinese rice wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red bean curd (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Set aside the remaining marinade for basting.</li>
        <li>Rake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for indirect cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes or longer.</li>

    </ol>
