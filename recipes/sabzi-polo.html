    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sabzi polo is an Iranian (Persian) dish of rice and chopped herbs, usually served with fish. In Persian, sabzi refers to herbs or vegetables (sabz means "green"); polo is pilaf, a style of cooked rice.</p>
    <p>Sabzi polo is a staple on the Persian New Year's table. It's made with basmati rice and layers of fresh herbs, but what is most coveted is the tahdig â€” the crunchy crust that forms on the bottom of the pot during cooking.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground saffron</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh chives or green onion</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 large flour tortilla</li>
        <li>2 whole bulbs garlic</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ghee or butter, melted</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>To bloom saffron, sprinkle saffron over a few ice cubes in a small bowl; let stand at room temperature until ice melts completely, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and return to a boil. Add rice; return to a boil and cook until rice is al dente, about 4 minutes. Drain rice and transfer to a large bowl. Dry pot.</li>
        <li>Stir chopped parsley, chives, dill, cilantro, cumin, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt into rice.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in pot over medium heat. Sprinkle sesame seeds and turmeric over oil. Top with tortilla then rice mixture. Remove any loose, papery outer layers from garlic bulbs; nestle bulbs into rice mixture. Poke five holes in rice using the handle of a wooden spoon to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with a clean kitchen towel, then cover the pot with a lid. Cook, covered, over medium heat until steam starts escaping, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ghee into bloomed saffron in small bowl; pour mixture over rice. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until rice is tender and garlic is softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove garlic; let cool until easy to handle, then peel each clove. Put serving platter upside down over pot and carefully invert rice onto platter. The tortilla tahdig will be on top.</li>
    </ol>
